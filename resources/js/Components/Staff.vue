                        I am a mum to four children. 3 girls and a little boy. I’ve lived in the Waterside all of my life and have spent many years caring for people. My most recent job was as as a Senior Care Lead in a nursing home. Here I quickly realised how easily an elderly person can lose their independence due to age and illness. I've spent a lifetime looking after others, it's what I do best and what I am passionate about so being able to support people to continue to live their lives the way they want to, in their own homes is what makes me happy.
                        The pandemic changed the way we were able to care for our aging relatives and I realised there was a 'gap' in the care sector. Many people are able to cope independently with their personal care needs but need that extra bit of assistance with things like housework, changing bed linen, preparing meals, transport to appointments, shopping or just spending time playing games or chatting over a cup of tea.
                        So in March 2021 Waterside Home Help was born. Now 2 years on we have an amazing team of Helpers assisting our clients throughout the Waterside. We are a close team and I couldn't be prouder of how far we have come. It is abundantly apparent in the testimonials that our helpers make a massive difference to their clients lives and reading the information given by the helpers it is also apparent the affect the clients have on us.

For some clients I am the only person they will see. I enjoy everything from a game of scrabble to some cleaning and everything in-between it really does make a difference to the clients which makes this job so rewarding.

                        a difference to my clients day, whether it is cleaning, shopping or just having a good chat.
                        I used to work in retail and so have had lots of experience with helping elderly clients and chatting
                        to them too but I never felt fulfilled. Now I really do and couldn't imagine ever working anywhere else.
                        I’ve worked for Waterside Home Help since December 2021.

                        I lived in Wales for 20 years but returned home to The Waterside three years ago. I love gardening and summer time is my favourite time of year.
                        I have worked for Waterside Home Help since March 2022 and what I enjoy most is that every day is a different day. It is so rewarding knowing I have been able to make a difference to my client’s lives.

I have been working for Waterside Home Help since August 2023, my favourite parts of both jobs was to assist people with household chores, shopping and socialising. I live for making people happy and comfortable so to find a role that joined the best parts of both roles together has been amazing. I am bubbly and chatty plus have a love for carpet lines and shiny taps. My hobbies are spending time with my family and going to any musical theatre shows I can. I love The West End; my ultimate dream would be to see a show in Broadway.

I have lived in the Waterside area my whole life and really love living here near to the New Forest and the beautiful beaches. My hobbies include walking my dogs, eating out, travelling and Zumba. I used to work in care when my children were much younger and found it really rewarding and after helping to care for my dad recently. I realised just how much I missed helping others who are less capable than myself. This is when I found Waterside Home Help - I’m thoroughly enjoying being back in the social care sector. Ruth and the team are so friendly and supportive and all the clients are really lovely.
